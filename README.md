# Demo-Robot
1. Installation
(1) Install Robot Framework: https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst
(2) Install Selenium2Library: https://github.com/robotframework/Selenium2Library/blob/master/INSTALL.rst
(3)
* Download chromedriver: http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.20/
* Put the executable file under Python installation folder. Ex, C:\Python27\chromedriver.exe
(4) Run command: pybot walmart.robot
(5) In resource.robot-line 6, you can try different search items(tv, dvd, socks, toys, iphone) by replacing existing one.

2. Meet Requirements
(1) I implemented all the requirements listed in the assignment file.
(2) Also, in order to make this scenario(Validate that item added is present in the cart and is the only item in the cart) work, each time after login will empty the shopping cart first and at the end of test, empty the cart again.

3. Robustness
(1) I've tried all the items in the pool to execute the test many times, it all ran smoothly. The test won't break except there exist real bugs in the development.
(2) report.html and log.html generated by robot framework contain the detailed information of the test execution. If Fail happens, the report fill will include the screen shot indication what your page looks like when bug happens.
   
4. Issues during Implementation
(1) The search result page of "toys" is somehow different with the search result page of other search items. So, here need some if else branches to differentiate them.
(2) When add iphone to cart, need to choose a color first.
